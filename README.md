This repository demonstrates a common error in Python:  a `RecursionError` caused by an improperly handled base case in a recursive function. The `factorial.py` file contains the buggy code, while `factorialSolution.py` provides the corrected version. The error arises when attempting to calculate the factorial of a negative number. The recursive function lacks a condition to handle such input, leading to infinite recursion and the `RecursionError`.  The solution adds a check for negative input, returning an appropriate error message or handling it gracefully.
